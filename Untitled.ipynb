    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Insurance companies face the challenge of accurately predicting the likelihood of claims on car insurance policies. With a variety of factors influencing claim frequency and severity, it is difficult to assess risk and determine appropriate premiums for policyholders. The problem arises from the complexity and variety of data involved, including demographic details, vehicle specifications, and past claim histories. Inaccurate predictions can lead to suboptimal premium pricing, financial loss, and inefficient claim management.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that analyzes this complex dataset to predict whether a car insurance claim will occur within a six-month period. The expected output is a model capable of accurately classifying policies into two categories: those likely to file a claim and those unlikely to do so. The model will provide actionable insights into the factors that contribute to the likelihood of claims."
